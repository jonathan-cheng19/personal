## Parametric Tiny House Fabricator

This repository now includes an experimental web studio for automatically generating unique, fabrication-aware tiny house concepts. Open `tiny-house-studio.html` in a modern browser to:

- Configure site, sustainability, and systems criteria.
- Synthesize dozens of distinct layouts with immersive 3D visualization powered by three.js.
- Inspect tabbed reports covering spatial programming, bill of materials, scheduling, and financial projections.
- Evaluate climate risk using live Open-Meteo climate datasets tied to the project location.
- Run a simulated 3D printing sequence and export a captured WebM video.

All computations run client-side; no build step is required.
